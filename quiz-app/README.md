## Future Plans

Right now, Tati's Terrific Trivia can only be played on the easy setting. Future iterations will take user input to set the difficulty level to either easy, medium, or hard. Other ideas include to switch the answer choices to multiple choice and allow the user to decide that as well as they're gearing up for the quiz on the landing page. Eventual versions of this game will also allow for other trivia categories.
