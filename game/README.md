# Spirit Animal

Using HTML and JS, Spirit Animal is a twist on a classic heads-or-tails coin flip. It answers the question, "Which pet is your spirit animal?" by showing the user one of three pictures of my pets, Daisy, Luke, or Han, after they click the randomizer button. Assuming users will want to click more than once, Spirit Animal offers a stats section to show the overall distribution of answers. This project is meant to spark joy and laughter to take the user back to their middle school days. Future implementations will offer more pet pictures and a chance to submit their own picture.
